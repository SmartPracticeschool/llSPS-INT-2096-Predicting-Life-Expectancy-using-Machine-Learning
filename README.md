Predicting Life Expectancy using Machine Learning

A typical Regression Machine Learning Project leverages historical data to predict insights into future. 
This Problem statement is aimed at Predicting Life Expectancy Rate of a country.

The term "Life Expectancy" refers to the numbers of years a person can expect to live. 
By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die.
Life Expectancy can be calculated by various  Factors that include  Gender, Genetics, Access to health care, hygiene,diet and nutrition and most impotantly LifeStyle.

The purpose of Predicting Life Expectancy is to track members of a particular cohort and predict the average age-at-death for them using a combination of observed mortality rates for past years and projections about mortality rates for future years.

Major Advantage is Life expectancy predictions have the potential to be beneficial to individuals, health service providers and governments. 
For instance, they would make people more aware of their general health, and its improvement or deterioration over time.

  Nowadays, due to the busy lifestyle of people, and with the amazing technologies along with junk food, people need to take care of their health. 
This Project of 'Predicting life expectancy' plays an important role about Adcvance care planning and in informming what changes to be made in one's lifestyle in order to extend the average life span that is predicted. People will choose this for their better health. 
Thus, leading to a good scope in future.

I have created this project in IBM Cloud account by using Auto Ai in Ibm Watson service.
